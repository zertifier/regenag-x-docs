Instead of downloading the dataset, the algorithm \u201cvisits\u201d a secure data room, processes information, and only returns results (metrics, aggregates, trained models).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"gaiax-standards":{"id":"gaiax-standards","title":"Gaia-X standards and interoperability","description":"Gaia-X defines a trust and interoperability framework to federate data spaces across sectors and countries. Its building blocks (self-descriptions, verifiable credentials, federated catalogs, compliance services, data usage agreements, etc.) let independent organizations collaborate while preserving data sovereignty.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"governance":{"id":"governance","title":"Governance model","description":"1.

Assets (datasets, algorithms) are published with metadata, policies, and pricing; file references can live on IPFS or private origins.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ontologies":{"id":"ontologies","title":"Ontologies and Smart Data Models","description":"Ontologies provide agreed vocabularies to describe data in a uniform, machine\u2011readable way. In a data space, this eases integration across heterogeneous sources, advanced querying, and algorithm reuse.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"use-cases":{"id":"use-cases","title":"Development of use cases in agri\u2011food data spaces","description":"Data spaces make it possible to build collaborative solutions where different actors in the agrifood sector can combine datasets, algorithms and services under a shared framework of trust. This section explains how use cases are designed and deployed within the RegenAg-X ecosystem, following a practical, outcome-oriented methodology aligned with European principles of data sovereignty and interoperable federated architectures.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"verifiable-credentials":{"id":"verifiable-credentials","title":"Verifiable Credentials and Gaia-X","description":"Verifiable Credentials (VCs) let holders prove attributes or facts (e.g., legal identity, roles, compliance) in a cryptographically secure way, verifiable without contacting the issuer, and under the holder\u2019s control. In Gaia-X, VCs and signed Self-Descriptions underpin the trust framework to identify participants, datasets, and services.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
