# Advanced CO₂ & Sensor Anomaly Detection (C2D)

## Purpose of the Algorithm

This algorithm performs second‑order analytics to detect anomalies that emerge only through statistical comparison, correlation, and distribution analysis.

It is intended as an advanced or premium Compute‑to‑Data component.

## What the Algorithm Does

### Extreme value detection
- **Identifies CO₂ spikes using percentile thresholds (P01 / P99)**
- **Flags rare or extreme environmental events**

### Anomaly aggregation
- **Counts and classifies anomaly frequency**
- **Supports anomaly density metrics**

### Correlation insights
- **Enables correlation between battery behavior and CO₂ anomalies**
- **Supports drift and instability analysis**

### Dataset health indicators
- **Produces compact anomaly KPIs**
- **Enables “data quality score” extensions**

## Value in a Compute‑to‑Data Workflow
- High insight density with minimal compute cost
- No raw values exposed
- Ideal for premium analytics tiers

## Industry Value
Supports:
- Environmental risk detection
- Dataset certification
- Advanced marketplace products
- Trust and compliance layers
