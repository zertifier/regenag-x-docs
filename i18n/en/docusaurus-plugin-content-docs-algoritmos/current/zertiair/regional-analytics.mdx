# Regional CO₂ Analytics & Benchmarking (C2D)

## Purpose of the Algorithm

This algorithm aggregates CO₂ measurements at the regional level to create a statistically robust environmental fingerprint per region. It enables comparison across regions while preserving the confidentiality of individual sensors and farms.

All processing occurs inside a secure Compute‑to‑Data pod.

## What the Algorithm Does

### Regional aggregation
- **Groups CO₂ measurements by region**
- **Computes global first‑order statistics:**
  - mean, median
  - min / max
  - P05 / P95 percentiles
  - standard deviation

### Temporal coverage
- **Identifies measurement date ranges per region**
- **Detects gaps and irregular coverage**

### Variability & stability
- **Measures dispersion and volatility of CO₂ values**
- **Identifies unusually stable or unstable regions**

### Cross‑region comparison (future‑ready)
- **Normalized outputs allow comparison as more regions are added**
- **Enables benchmarking and clustering**

## Value in a Compute‑to‑Data Workflow
- Enables multi‑region analytics without data leakage
- Creates reusable regional environmental KPIs
- Supports anonymized benchmarking products

## Industry Value
Useful for:
- Environmental monitoring platforms
- Regulatory reporting
- Location selection and impact assessment
- Marketplace‑ready regional CO₂ datasets
