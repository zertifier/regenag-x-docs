# Temporal CO₂ Analytics (Day/Night & Trends) (C2D)

## Purpose of the Algorithm

This algorithm focuses on temporal dynamics in CO₂ measurements, identifying daily cycles, trends, and time‑dependent anomalies that are not visible in static aggregates.

## What the Algorithm Does

### Day vs night segmentation
- **Separates measurements into day and night windows**
- **Computes mean and median CO₂ for each period**
- **Calculates day‑night amplitude (Δ)**

### Temporal stability
- **Identifies sensors or regions with abnormal nocturnal behavior**
- **Detects volatility differences between day and night**

### Trend estimation
- **Identifies increasing or decreasing CO₂ tendencies**
- **Supports long‑term monitoring use cases**

### Anomaly enrichment
- **Highlights time‑localized spikes**
- **Detects unusual temporal patterns**

## Value in a Compute‑to‑Data Workflow
- Adds contextual meaning to raw ppm values
- Enables storytelling and explainable analytics
- Keeps raw timestamps private

## Industry Value
Applicable to:
- Environmental impact studies
- Operational monitoring
- Alerting and forecasting pipelines
- KPI‑driven dashboards
