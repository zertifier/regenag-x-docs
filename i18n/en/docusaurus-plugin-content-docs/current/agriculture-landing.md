# Data spaces for the agri‑food industry

Agriculture generates large volumes of data (soil, weather, machinery, imagery, traceability) spread across many actors. A data space lets you share and orchestrate that value securely, with data sovereignty, monetization, and automation.

How an agri data space helps
- Interoperability among farms, cooperatives, suppliers, and public administrations.
- AI and analytics close to the data with Compute‑to‑Data to preserve privacy.
- Flexible business models: pay‑per‑use, subscriptions, contribution incentives.

Why it’s a good idea now
- Gaia‑X standards and markets like Ocean Enterprise reduce friction.
- Open ontologies (SAREF, Smart Data Models) speed up integration.
- Verifiability and auditability increase regulatory and sector trust.

Pitch
- Publish your datasets with clear policies, expose trusted algorithms, and generate revenue without losing control. Our initial deployment in the Azores Islands (Portugal) shows the value with per‑field soil analyses and granular access control.
