# Gaia-X standards and interoperability

Gaia-X defines a trust and interoperability framework to federate data spaces across sectors and countries. Its building blocks (self-descriptions, verifiable credentials, federated catalogs, compliance services, data usage agreements, etc.) let independent organizations collaborate while preserving data sovereignty.

Interoperability keys
- Reusable data models and vocabularies to describe participants, datasets, and services.
- Verifiable trust mechanisms (signatures, policies, automatable compliance).
- Federations: catalogs and marketplaces sharing events and metadata securely.

Cross-industry and cross-border impact
- Cross-border exchange thanks to comparable identities and policies.
- Reuse of use cases in adjacent domains (agri, energy, logistics, health) without redoing integrations.
- Reduced integration costs and time-to-value.

In our agri data space, we leverage GXDCH-compliant self-descriptions so datasets and services are discoverable by federated catalogs and AI agents.
