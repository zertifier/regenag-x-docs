# Success stories: Interoperability

This success story in the pig sector explores the data-sharing opportunities offered by data spaces, especially regarding how data-sharing barriers could be reduced while ensuring that data originators maintain control of their data. Therefore, the implementation of the data space is based on the Gaia‑X Pontus‑X ecosystem, using a Web3‑ and blockchain‑based infrastructure that provides Data Sovereignty by Design. In addition, since Pontus‑X is based on Gaia‑X, its building blocks are used to facilitate the federation of the data space, especially the Gaia‑X Digital Clearing House (GXDCH). Specifically:

- All participants are identified using self‑descriptions validated by the GXDCH Compliance service, which is based on the trust framework provided by the GXDCH Registry. In addition, the GXDCH Notary service is used to generate a Verifiable Credential with the legal registration number for all participants. The compliant self‑descriptions for the participants are:
  - Producers: pig farms, farm associations and cooperatives.
  - Data consumers: meat industry, retail and logistics.
  - Service providers: data analytics companies, veterinary services, logistics service providers, etc.
  - Intermediaries: compute‑to‑data providers and GXDCH service providers.
- Data resources and processing services are described using Gaia‑X compliant descriptions, enabling their discovery and consumption in a sovereign, interoperable and federated manner.
- Policies for access and use of resources are defined using smart contracts within the Pontus‑X framework, enabling the application of usage restrictions and traceability of the processing carried out.

As a result, data owners can expose their data for analysis without transferring direct control, while data consumers and service providers can carry out analytics and AI tasks in a trusted environment that respects data sovereignty and complies with sectoral regulations.
