# Ocean Protocol, marketplace and IPFS

Ocean Protocol enables marketplaces for data and AI services with smart contracts and a flexible permission system. Assets (datasets, algorithms) are published with metadata, policies, and pricing; file references can live on IPFS or private origins.

Key components
- Tokens and transactions: each asset can be tokenized (ERC‑20) for governance and pricing; consumption is paid per on‑chain transaction.
- Ocean Node: orchestrates publishing, permissions, Compute‑to‑Data and blockchain registration.
- Distributed system: data stays where it is while compute moves to the data.
- Ocean Enterprise: an analogous/derived market aligned with Gaia‑X to federate catalogs and monetization, interoperating with Verifiable Credentials.

Benefits
- Transparent, auditable monetization.
- Separation of public metadata and private data.
- Compute‑to‑Data integration to protect data sovereignty.
